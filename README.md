## RELEASES

 * 2012-10-15 :: 0.0.3-SNAPSHOT
 
   *  Refactored Gpio interfaces to permit extensible GpioProviders for add-on devices.
   *  Refactored Gpio interfaces to separate digital, analog, and PWM types of input and output pins.
   *  Added support for analog GPIO pins (interfaces, methods and events). 
   *  Added Olimex AVR-IO-M16 GpioProvider to serve as an example of extending a new GpioProvider for GPIO expansion. 
   *  Added Olimex AVR-IO-M16 sources for ARV micro-controller.
   *  Removed setDirection() from GpioPin; embedded this functionality into existing setMode() method.  Eliminating duplication. 
   *  Added support for I2C communication.

 * 2012-09-23 :: 0.0.2-SNAPSHOT
 
   *  Refactored Gpio interface to permit methods using Pin argument to function without requiring a GpioPin to first be provisioned
   *  Added OSGi manifest 
   *  Optimized GPIO interrupt thread handling to only be created if GpioPin listeners or triggers have been registered.
   *  Now disabling/stopping GPIO interrupt native thread monitoring if all GpioPin listeners or triggers are unregistered.
   *  Added additional convenience methods in GpioPin interface for evaluating state, direction, resistance, mode, etc. 
   *  There were two Gpio classes; renamed one to GpioController to avoid confusion.
   *  Added OSGi service project to export Pi4J GPIO as an OSGi service.  

 * 2012-09-19 :: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
 
   *  Initial ALPHA release
