/**
 * <h1>Serial Interface</h1>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a set of functions for 'Serial' communication.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Before using the Pi4J library, you need to ensure that the Java VM in configured with access to
 * the following system libraries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>pi4j</li>
 * <li>wiringPi</li>
 * </ul>
 * <blockquote> This library depends on the wiringPi native system library.</br> (developed by
 * Gordon Henderson @ <a href="https://projects.drogon.net/">https://projects.drogon.net/</a>)
