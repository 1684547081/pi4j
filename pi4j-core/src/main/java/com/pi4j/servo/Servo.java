/**
 * <p> This is abstraction an servo. It has dual way into servo position: float point where 'normal' 
 * servo arm position is defined with value between 0.0f to 1.0f, while values below zero and above
 * one are still allowed (providing that servo driver supports them). </p>
 * <p> Normally 0.0f should correspond to ordinary RC servo pulse size of1000us while 
 * pulse size of 2000us is defined by value of 1.0f.</p
 * <p> In parallel to float point there is ability to drive servo using raw, integer values.
 * Implementation should provide minimum and maximum int values supported by servo abstraction
 * implementation.</p>
