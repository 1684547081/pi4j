/**
 * <h1>WiringPi SPI Library</h1>
 * 
 * <p>
 * WiringPi includes a software-driven PWM handler capable of outputting a PWM signal on any of the
 * Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are some limitations. To maintain a low CPU usage, the minimum pulse width is 100uS. That
 * combined with the default suggested range of 100 gives a PWM frequency of 100Hz. You can lower
 * the range to get a higher frequency, at the expense of resolution, or increase to get more
 * resolution, but that will lower the frequency. If you change the pulse-width in the drive code,
 * then be aware that at delays of less than 100uS wiringPi does it in a software loop, which means
 * that CPU usage will rise dramatically, and controlling more than one pin will be almost
 * impossible.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Also note that while the routines run themselves at a higher and real-time priority, Linux can
 * still affect the accuracy of the generated signal.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * However, within these limitations, control of a light/LED or a motor is very achievable.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>You must initialize wiringPi with one of wiringPiSetup() or wiringPiSetupGpio() functions
 * beforehand. wiringPiSetupSys() is not fast enough, so you must run your programs with sudo.</b>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Before using the Pi4J library, you need to ensure that the Java VM in configured with access to
 * the following system libraries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>pi4j</li>
 * <li>wiringPi</li>
 * <li>pthread</li>
 * </ul>
 * <blockquote> This library depends on the wiringPi native system library.</br> (developed by
 * Gordon Henderson @ <a href="https://projects.drogon.net/">https://projects.drogon.net/</a>)
