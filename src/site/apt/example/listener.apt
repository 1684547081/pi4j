GPIO State Listener Example using Pi4J.

  The following example demonstrates how to setup a listener for GPIO pin state changes on the Raspberry Pi.  
  This listener implementation is far more efficient than constantly polling and querying for the the GPIO pin state.  
  The listener implementation is based on GPIO hardware interrupts not state polling.

* Source Code 
   
  The source code for this example is included in the github repository: {{https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/tree/master/src/test/java/com/pi4j/io/example}}
