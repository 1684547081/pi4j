GPIO Triggers Example using Pi4J.

  The following example demonstrates how to setup GPIO triggers.  GPIO Triggers listen for pin state changes and then perform some action on on alternate GPIO pin or perform a callback to a user specified method.  
  Pi4J includes several built in pre-defined trigger implementation classes or you can create your own trigger by implementing the GpioTrigger interface.  
  Triggers are based on the GPIO listener implementation and rely on GPIO hardware interrupts not state polling.

* Source Code 
   
  The source code for this example is included in the github repository: {{https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/tree/master/src/test/java/com/pi4j/example}}

* Download
  
  First, copy the <TriggerGpioExample.java> source file to a directory on the RaspberryPi.\
  You can use the following command on the Pi's console or SSH terminal to download the example source file directly to your Pi:
  
  <<<wget https://raw.github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/master/src/test/java/com/pi4j/example/TriggerGpioExample.java>>>

* Compile
  
  Next, use the following command to compile this example program:
  
  <<<javac -cp pi4j.jar -d . TriggerGpioExample.java>>>
  
* Execute
  
  The following command will run this example program:
  
  <<<sudo java -classpath .:pi4j.jar com.pi4j.example.TriggerGpioExample>>>
  
* Output

  The LED attached to GPIO pin 21 should turn ON when the momentary button is pressed and OFF when the button is released.
  
  The LED attached to GPIO pin 22 should turn ON when the momentary button is pressed and OFF when the button is released.
  
  The LED attached to GPIO pin 23 should turn ON for 1 second when the momentary button is pressed.   The button release has no effect on this LED.

  The following message should be displayed on the console each time the momentary button is pressed and again when released.
